# Hvolume

Calculates the H-volume of a n-box (or n-interval, a higher dimensional interval) J in a space with some measure H, where J is made from the carteesian product of n intervals J = I_{1} x I_{2} x ... x I_{n}

Calculates the probability mass in a n-box J (a box made out of n intervals J = ) in a space with some distribution function H
