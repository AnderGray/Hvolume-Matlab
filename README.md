# Hvolume

Calculates the H-volume of a n-box J in a space with some measure H. The n-box J is some higher dimensional rectangle made from the carteesian product of n intervals:



Calculates the probability mass in a n-box J in a space with some distribution function H (cdf).

Usefull in probability theory, the H-volume computes the mass within some n-box from a multivartiate cdf H. 

The two dimensional calculation is:




If the H-volume, then your function is n-increasing
